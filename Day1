Task 1:
-------
Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2:
1. Multiplexing - HTTP1.1 send one request at a time. But HTTP2 send all the request at the time using single TCP connection. 
   Because of this one request will not wait for another reqeust to complete. This will improve the page performance.
   
 2. Prioritization - In HTTP2, developers have the control over which file has to load first. Developers can prioritize the important file to load instead of less important file 
    load first. This will also helps to improve the page performance.
